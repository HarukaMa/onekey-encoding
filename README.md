One-key encoding
===============

A shell script for fansub groups to rapidly release works.
Brought to you by Haruka @ Makari.
Original idea by Zht @ MakariTsukiyo.

# Prerequisites

- `ffmpeg` with required libraries compiled in
- `wine` with AviSynth installed (optional)
- `avs2yuv` (optional)

# Description, Usage, etc.

The script itself has included a manpage-like documentation. Invoke with `-h` to read it.
You can also read the source code to see detailed encoding parameters.

This script is in the early stage, and needs some improvements (both in docs and script itself).
Feel free to contribute!
